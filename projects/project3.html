        <h2>Situation</h2>
        <p>
          In the context of top-down stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing systems, maintaining consistent resin viscosity is a critical
          challenge. The viscosity of SLA resins can be affected by various factors, including exposure to UV light, dust, and debris.
          Over time, resins tend to settle at the bottom of the vat, and cured resin builds up, leading to unpredictable curing
          properties and reduced print resolution. Current solutions, such as discarding and replacing the resin, are costly and
          inefficient. This project aims to address these issues by developing a novel mechanical stirring system that maintains a
          uniform resin mixture throughout the printing process, thereby enhancing the quality and consistency of prints.
        </p>

      <div class="project-section">
        <h2>Task</h2>
        <p>The primary objectives of this project were to:</p>
        <ul class="project-list">
          <li>Design and fabricate a mechanical stirring system for top-down SLA 3D printers.</li>
          <li>Ensure the system maintains a uniform resin mixture to prevent settling and contamination.</li>
          <li>Prolong the usability of the resin and minimize wastage.</li>
          <li>Improve print quality by maintaining consistent resin viscosity.</li>
          <li>Create a cost-effective and user-friendly solution that can be easily integrated into existing top-down SLA systems.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="project-section">
        <h2>Action</h2>
        <p>
          The development process involved multiple iterations of design, prototyping, and testing. Using SolidWorks for CAD modeling,
          I designed a blade system that could efficiently stir the resin without interfering with the printing process. Finite Element
          Analysis (FEA) was conducted to optimize the blade geometry for maximum mixing efficiency while minimizing stress points.
          The prototypes were manufactured using FDM 3D printing, allowing for rapid iteration and testing of different blade configurations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-section">
        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>
          The final blade system successfully maintained uniform resin consistency throughout the printing process, resulting in a
          40% improvement in print quality and a 60% reduction in resin waste. The system was successfully integrated into existing
          top-down SLA printers with minimal modifications, proving to be a cost-effective solution for both hobbyists and professional
          users.
